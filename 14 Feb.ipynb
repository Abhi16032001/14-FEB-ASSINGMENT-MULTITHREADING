    "Q1. What is multithreading? why it is used? Name the module used to handle thread in python.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: Multithreading : Multithreading is the technique for improving the performance of application by allowing multiple threads to execute concurrently within the program. it is implimented on program by creating a new thread and passing function in thet thread. you can then start the program and it will run concurrrently within the main thread of the programm\n",
    "\n",
    "     Multithreading is used to improve the performance of program. you can run multiple programs at a same time withoust waiting for one program to finish before running the next one. This can be particularly useful for tasks that involve waiting for external resources, such as reading from a file or making a network request. \n",

    "\n",
    "Disadvantage:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1 Complexity: Multithreading can make your code more complex, as you need to manage multiple threads and ensure that they are synchronized correctly. This can make debugging more difficult and increase the likelihood of race conditions.\n",

    "    2 Increased memory usage: Each thread requires additional memory to store its state and execution context, which can increase the overall memory usage of your application.\n",

    "Q6. Explain deadlocks and race conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: Deadlock and race condition are two common problems that can occur in Python programs when multiple threads or processes are involved.\n",
    "\n",
    "Deadlock occurs when two or more threads or processes are blocked and waiting for each other to release a resource. This situation can arise when each thread holds a resource that another thread needs, and both threads are waiting for the other to release the resource they need. As a result, the threads are stuck in an infinite loop of waiting, and the program becomes unresponsive.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider a scenario where two threads each hold a lock on a resource that the other thread needs. If both threads attempt to acquire the lock at the same time, they will both be blocked and unable to proceed, resulting in a deadlock.\n",
    "\n",
    "Race condition, on the other hand, occurs when the outcome of a program depends on the relative timing or ordering of multiple threads or processes. This can lead to unpredictable and inconsistent behavior, as the timing and order of thread execution can vary each time the program is run.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider a scenario where two threads access a shared variable at the same time. If one thread reads the variable while the other thread is in the middle of writing to it, the result will depend on the timing of the threads and may be unpredictable."
